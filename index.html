        Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛɐ̯ˈtseːdəsˌbɛnts, -dɛs-] (listen)),[6][7] commonly referred to as
        Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926.
        Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart,
        Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles badged
        as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses)
        are managed by Daimler Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in
        late 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31
        million passenger cars.[8]

        The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz
        Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled
        automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".[9]
